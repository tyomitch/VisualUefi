## Synopsis

VisualUEFI is 

* A Solution and set of Visual Studio Project Files to allow building the official EDK-II (including OpenSSL 1.1.0e) without the use of inf files, python and 50 other build tools, a custom dependency tracker and build system, and twenty other custom pieces of code.
  The EDK-II and OpenSSL are present as submodules, directly from the official TianoCore Tree, and no changes are done to them.

* A Solution and couple of Visual Studio Project Files to show four UEFI sample components: An UEFI Application and associated UEFI Boot Driver, the EDK-II Sample FtdiUsbSerialDxe Driver, and the EDK-II Sample Cryptest Application which uses OpenSSL 1.1.0e. The code is 100% EDK-II compatible, but built with VisualUEFI instead.

* A working and FAST copy of QEMU64 2.10 for Windows, with a fairly recent UEFI 2.6 OVMF Secure Boot ROM which includes SMM support and an actual protected flash for enrolling PK/KEK/DB/DBX keys. These will updated on an ongoing basis as needed. This is integrated with the Visual Studio Sample Solution so that pressing F5 will spin up the instance for testing.

## Code Example

Here is a very simple example of a UEFI application communicating with a UEFI driver protocol. This sample is part of VisualUefi.

```c
//
// Basic UEFI Libraries
//
#include <Uefi.h>
#include <Library/UefiLib.h>
#include <Library/DebugLib.h>
#include <Library/MemoryAllocationLib.h>

//
// Boot and Runtime Services
//
#include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>
#include <Library/UefiRuntimeServicesTableLib.h>

//
// Custom Driver Protocol
//
#include "../UefiDriver/drvproto.h"
EFI_GUID gEfiSampleDriverProtocolGuid = EFI_SAMPLE_DRIVER_PROTOCOL_GUID;

//
// We run on any UEFI Specification
//
extern CONST UINT32 _gUefiDriverRevision = 0;

//
// Our name
//
CHAR8 *gEfiCallerBaseName = "UefiApplication";

EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
UefiUnload (
    IN EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle
    )
{
    //
    // This code should be compiled out and never called
    //
    ASSERT(FALSE);
}

EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
UefiMain (
    IN EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle,
    IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE* SystemTable
    )
{
    EFI_STATUS efiStatus;
    SHELL_FILE_HANDLE fileHandle;
    UINT8 buffer[4];
    UINTN readSize;
    EFI_SAMPLE_DRIVER_PROTOCOL* sampleProtocol;

    // 
    // Print stuff out 
    // 
    fileHandle = NULL;
    Print(L"Hello World! My handle is %lx and System Table is at %p\n",
          ImageHandle, SystemTable);

    //
    // Initialize the shell library
    //
    efiStatus = ShellInitialize();
    if (EFI_ERROR(efiStatus))
    {
        Print(L"Failed to initialize shell: %lx\n", efiStatus);
        goto Exit;
    }

    //
    // Open ourselves
    //
    efiStatus = ShellOpenFileByName(L"fs1:\\UefiApplication.efi",
                                    &fileHandle,
                                    EFI_FILE_MODE_READ,
                                    0);
    if (EFI_ERROR(efiStatus))
    {
        Print(L"Failed to open ourselves: %lx\n", efiStatus);
        fileHandle = NULL;
        goto Exit;
    }

    //
    // Read 4 bytes at the top (MZ header)
    //
    readSize = sizeof(buffer);
    efiStatus = ShellReadFile(fileHandle, &readSize, &buffer);
    if (EFI_ERROR(efiStatus))
    {
        Print(L"Failed to read ourselves: %lx\n", efiStatus);
        goto Exit;
    }

    //
    // Print it
    //
    Print(L"Data: %lx\n", *(UINT32*)buffer);

    // 
    // Check if the sample driver is loaded 
    // 
    efiStatus = gBS->LocateProtocol(&gEfiSampleDriverProtocolGuid, NULL, &sampleProtocol);
    if (EFI_ERROR(efiStatus))
    {
        Print(L"Failed to locate our driver: %lx\n", efiStatus);
        goto Exit;
    }

    // 
    // Print the value and exit 
    // 
    Print(L"Sample driver is loaded: %lx\n", sampleProtocol->SampleValue);

Exit:
    //
    // Close our file handle
    //
    if (fileHandle != NULL)
    {
        ShellCloseFile(&fileHandle);
    }

    //
    // Sample complete!
    //
    return efiStatus;
}

```

## Motivation

Although EDK-II's build subsystem supports Visual Studio, it doesn't work with "in-IDE" building. Instead, special .inf files and other templates are used to define projects, and a custom build composed of multiple 3rd party
tools must be ran -- including dependencies on Python, Ruby, and Perl. For developers already familiar with Visual Studio's project files/MSBUILD, as well as the IDE it offers, this can be cumbersome and limiting, slowing down
the ability to quickly jump into UEFI development. Additionally, the EDK-II's default "test" environment is to build a Windows "NT32" layer around your application and running it as a command line executable. While this might
work for very simple applications, it doesn't reliably provide an environment for testing DXE drivers, runtime services, and more.

VisualUefi aims to bridge these gaps by compiling 100% unmodified EDK-II libraries with a proper Visual Studio build environment, adding some VisualUefi-specific glue to support building within Visual Studio without 3rd
party tools, and includes the latest QEMU and OVMF w/ SecureBoot packages for bare-metal testing of UEFI, without relying on Windows emulation.

## Installation

You should be able to open the EDK-II.SLN file and build without any issues in either Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 or 2019. WDK is not needed.

Once the EDK-II libraries are built, you should be able to open the SAMPLES.SLN file and build the samples, which will create UefiApplication.efi, UefiDriver.efi, Cryptest.efi, and FtdiUsbSerialDxe.efi

## Documentation

Please refer to EDK-II/TianoCore for all documentation/help regarding EDK-II.

## Tests

You can press F5 (Run/Debug) from within the Sample Solution, which should spin up the QEMU instance with 512MB of RAM, and your release directory as a virtual file system accessible through fs1:

You can then try loading the driver as follows:

	* load fs1:\UefiDriver.efi

You can verify its presence by using either of these commands:

	* drivers (Should display "Sample Driver")
	* devtree (Should show a few "Sample Device" entries)

You can also launch the sample application, which should find the driver:

	* fs1:\UefiApplication.efi
